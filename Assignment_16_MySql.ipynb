    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that enables efficient retrieval, updating, and management of that data. It acts as a central repository for storing and managing data, allowing users to interact with it through queries, updates, and other operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system1. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). The data in common databases is modeled in tables, making querying and processing efficient. Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.\n",

    "#### SQL Databases3:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are primarily called Relational Databases (RDBMS); they define and manipulate data based on a structured query language (SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases require you to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. All of your data must follow the same structure. This can \n",
    "require significant up-front preparation.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that you can increase the load on a single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU, or SSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are table-based, making them a better option for applications that require multi-row transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are primarily called non-relational or distributed databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways: it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a key-value store.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding more servers in your NoSQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph databases, or wide-column stores. This makes NoSQL databases a better option for applications that require large data sets that don’t have a clear schema."

    "4. TRUNCATE: TRUNCATE is used to remove all rows from a table while keeping the table structure intact. It's faster than using DELETE, as it doesn't log individual row deletions.\n",

    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Students;\n",

    "A Primary Key is a unique identifier assigned to each record within a database table. It is an attribute or a set of attributes that help to uniquely identify the tuples (records) in the relational table. The primary key provides the means to distinguish one tuple from all the others in the relation. Since the primary key is used to identify the tuples of a relation none of its attribute values can be null. \n",

    "#### Foreign Key:\n",

    "A Foreign Key is a column or columns in a database that are linked to a column in a different table. The existence of a foreign key column establishes a foreign key constraint – a database rule that ensures that a value can be added or updated in one column only if the same value already exists in the linked column. For example, a table of customer orders might have a user column with a foreign key attribute that links it to the user_id column in a users table. This way, each row in the orders table can be associated with a specific user from the users table — and no orders can enter the system unless they’re connected to a valid, existing user.\n",
